# EvilCrow RF V2

  

![Banner](docs/media/img/Banner_V2.png)

EvilCrow RF V2 is an open-source project providing firmware, tools and a mobile app for sub-GHz radio research, testing and experimentation. The project centers on an ESP32-based controller using CC1101 transceivers and a companion Flutter mobile app for BLE control, plus Python SDR tools and a web-based firmware flasher.

## Supported Hardware

  

- EvilCrowRF-V2 [[link]](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/1005007868951389.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2ita4itemAdapt)- [[link]](https://labs.ksec.co.uk/product/evil-crow-rf-v2/)
- Storage: LittleFS (internal) and SD card support (max 32GB) (FAT32 FS)

  

## Key Features

  

- CC1101 driver and dual-module support for sub-GHz operations

- 33+ protocol brute-force engine and De Bruijn attack modes

- Universal Sweep mode (automated multi-frequency scanning)

- Pause / Resume bruter state persisted via LittleFS

- BLE-based binary protocol with chunked transfers and notifications

- OTA over BLE with MD5 verification (app ↔ device workflow)

- Web flasher UI (ESP Web Tools manifest + GitHub releases integration)

- Flutter mobile app: BLE controller, quick actions, OTA checks

- [SDR-like tools and Python utilities (spectrum scan, raw RX, URH bridge)](https://github.com/Senape3000/EvilCrowRF-V2/tree/main/SDR)

- Battery monitoring and status notifications via BLE

  

See `docs/` for detailed guides, attack-method documentation, and developer notes.

  

## Quick Start

  

Requirements: PlatformIO / PIOArduino (for firmware), Flutter (for mobile app), Python 3.8+ (for SDR tools).

  

Build firmware (PlatformIO):

  

```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]

# Open the project folder in VSCode with PlatformIO extension installed
# Wait for PlatformIO to complete the initial setup (dependencies, libraries, etc.)

# Build the firmware
pio run

# Upload to device
pio run --target upload

#Or use the PlatformIO GUI in VSCode: click the "Build" button in the upper toolbar, then "Upload" once the build completes successfully.

```

  

Build mobile app (Android):

  

```bash

todo

```

  

Run SDR tools (example):

  

```bash

todo

```

  

***Web flasher***: open the hosted flasher URL above. The web flasher fetches releases and drives ESP Web Tools for in-browser flashing.

  

## OTA & Releases

  

- Releases follow semantic versioning. Firmware and app releases are published to GitHub releases and referenced by the web flasher.

- Typical assets: `evilcrow-v2-fw-vX.Y.Z.bin`, `evilcrow-v2-fw-vX.Y.Z.bin.md5`, `EvilCrowRF-vX.Y.Z.apk`.

- OTA high-level protocol: device commands include OTA begin, chunked data transfer, end and reboot. The app verifies MD5 before the transfer.

 

## Project Structure

  

-  `src/` — firmware C/C++ sources

-  `include/` — shared headers and message definitions

-  `lib/` — external libraries and drivers (e.g., CC1101 driver)

-  `mobile_app/` — Flutter mobile controller (UI + BLE code)

-  `web-flasher/` — static web flasher site (index.html, app.js)

-  `SDR/` — Python SDR utilities

-  `docs/` — documentation, guides, schematics and plans

  

## Development & Contributing

  

- Follow existing coding style and keep changes focused.

- Use PlatformIO for building and flashing firmware; Windows helper scripts are provided (`build_firmware.bat`, `flash_firmware.bat`).

- Mobile contributions: work inside `mobile_app/` (Flutter); see `mobile_app/README.md` for setup.

- Tests & tools: there are Python helpers and test harnesses for the bruter module under `tools/` and `SDR/`.
  

## Future Work

- Add dictionary attack mode (wordlist-based brute-force)

- Explore rolling-code analysis tooling

- Add multi-frequency protocol variants (Chamberlain/Liftmaster/etc.)

- Enhance DuckyScript parser (REPEAT, DELAY, multi-key combos)

- Complete app localization

- Add De Bruijn support for larger n (14/16) after verifying heap budget
